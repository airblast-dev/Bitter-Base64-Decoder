## What does it do?
Bitter detects and reacts to Base64 or basE91 encoded text, urls, magnets based on settings the server owner sets on discord. Once a user clicks on the reaction Bitter will DM them with the decoded version. It will also work with embed messages. The url and magnet link detection works so that it will react if it includes an url. See examples below.

### Refresh Detections
This is an app you can use to Refresh the Detections on a message. If for any reason the bot wasnt able to see the channel or was offline, this allows to manually request an update to its reactions.
